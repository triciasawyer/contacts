# Lab 43 - React Native

## Author: Tricia Sawyer

### Features

Over the next 2 lab coding sessions, you will create your first Phone App. What it does and how it looks is up to you. This is an opportunity to play around with whats possible in React Native and to get a feel for how you can get into the various device features.

This app uses the native device feature, Contacts. By connecting to my phone, I am able to access my contacts and make a call through this app.

### Demo

When you first open my app, it displays a list of my contacts from my phone, like so:

![Contact](/assets/contacts.png)

The user is able to click on a name within the contact list, where you will be taken to their contact profile. You can then either choose to call them or send a message.
