# React Native Mobile App

## Author: Tricia Sawyer

This project is an opportunity to delve into the capabilities of React Native and harness native device features.

### Getting Started

To run the app, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Expo app: `npx create-expo-app <app name>`
2. Navigate to the app directory: `cd <app name>`
3. Start the app: `npx expo start`

### Features

This React Native Mobile App leverages the native Contacts feature of your device. By connecting to your phone, it grants access to your contacts and enables you to make calls directly through the app.

### Demo

Upon opening the app, you'll be greeted with a list of your contacts, as shown below:
